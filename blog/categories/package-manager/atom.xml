<p>Java has ivy and maven.</p>

<p>Every language has a package manager except C++.</p>

<p>I really have the feeling of standing on the shoudlders of giants when using Maven. But when programming with C++, I feel that I have fallen down to the ground. There are too much tedious work you have to do even for a small task. There are too few standard libraries easy to use. Yes, there exists a excellent library named Boost, which is a very powerfull complement of STL. However, in China, the most company in my knowledge even don't use STL, no matter to say Boost. Every department maybe has its own basic library possibly called base or common. Those libraries just re-implement STL and add some thread-safe features perhaps. But they also may bring some bugs and cannot supply enough utilities as STL. They usually have little document too. The situation maybe better in other places, but the lack of open libraries and automated tools for C++ is absolutely a fact.</p>

<p>C++, can you be more friendly to a newbie?</p>
