    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have worked for half and one years. The past year means much more be me as a freshman.</p>

<p>During the past year, I have written 3 application projects, each has about 5000 lines of code(LOC) and an AC-Automation library. Now I know how to write a project with 10k LOC and how to design the interfaces of each class.</p>

<p>I leaned to use some NoSQL databases such as <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, <a href="http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/">Kyoto Cabinet</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">LevelDB</a>. I also read some code of those projects. I began to read open source code, but I haven't finished a whole project. Anyway, it's a good start and I have got some sense of how a big system is constructed. I deeply realize that reading code is really a nessarry and efficient way to improve my coding skills.</p>

<p>I began to use <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> to manage my code.

<p>I used <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/">Wikispaces</a> and <a href="http://www.xmind.net/">XMind</a> to manage my knowledge. I have created about 100 wiki pages and 40 mind maps.</p>

<p>I began to use MacBook Air. It gives me a very nice experience and effectively improves my production.</p>
